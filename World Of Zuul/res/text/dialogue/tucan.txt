HELLO MY DEAR FRIEND! TUCTUC IS SO GLAD TO SEE YOU!
WHEN TUCTUC HEARD YOU WERE GOING TO SAVE THE FOREST TUCTUC COULDN’T SIT STILL!
SO TUCTUC HAVE GATHERED SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU!

"About half of the world’s tropical forests have already been cleared or degraded.
Within 100 years, there will be no rainforests left in the world."
