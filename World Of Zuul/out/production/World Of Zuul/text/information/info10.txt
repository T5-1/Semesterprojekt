Here is a little about the trees’ ecosystem. Let’s talk about an oak tree.
The tree receives sunlight from the sun, it receives water from the rain, nutrients from 
the soil and Carbon Dioxide from people and lots of other places! In return, the tree 
produces Oxygen and Acorns. Then a squirrel might eat the acorn and exhale 
Carbon dioxide. When the squirrel dies, it turns into soil, which will once again feed 
the tree.
